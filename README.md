CINErate
CINErate is made to a home for film reviews adn information.

CINErate offers the user to view and look information created by the owner of the site me.
The site currently has 21 films but the ideal goal would be to grow from there. This site is also helpful to me to record and log films I have watched in the past and review them and score them.

The site uses role-based authentication changing from Admin, User, and Guest.

The site is a prototype of what could be here, eventually this site will be full-functioning and work in stride with a database from mySQL.
